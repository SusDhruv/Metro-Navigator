# 🚇 Metro Navigator – Shortest Path Visualizer for Metro Systems

**Metro Navigator** is a browser-based metro route planning tool that visualizes the **shortest path between two stations** using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**. Designed for intuitive navigation, it helps commuters and urban planners explore the optimal route through a metro network while displaying intermediate stations, distance, and estimated fare.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔁 **Shortest Path Finder** – Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient route between two stations.
- 📍 **Intermediate Stations Display** – Lists all stations passed in the journey.
- 📏 **Distance Calculation** – Shows total travel distance between source and destination.
- 💸 **Fare Estimation** – Computes estimated fare based on travel slabs (customizable).
- 🗺️ **Visual Metro Map UI** – Clean, interactive metro layout using HTML/CSS/JS.
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – No frameworks or external libraries used.
- 🔌 **Offline Support** – Fully functional without internet as no real-time APIs are used.
- 🧩 **Modular Code** – Easy to extend to other algorithms (e.g., BFS, A* in the future).
